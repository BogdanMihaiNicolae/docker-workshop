# [![docker.com](https://www.docker.com/favicons/favicon-32x32.png)](https://www.docker.com/) Docker workshop

This workshop will take you from "Hello Docker" to deploying a containerized web application to a server. There are no specific skills needed for this tutorial beyond a basic comfort with the command line and using a text editor.

The Workshop is separated in three sections:

* [Docker Basics](doc/00-docker-basics)
* [Docker Machine](doc/01-docker-machine)
* [Docker Compose](doc/02-docker-compose)
* [Docker Swarm](doc/03-docker-swarm)

This is, of course, a continuous work in progress; feel free to propose changes and spread the word.


### Preparations:

Please [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) 

### Assumptions:

* During workshop we will use different ports. If they are not available on your machine, adjust the CLI commands accordingly.
